教えてくれプロの美学か.

明日は雨だよ.

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,100
天気予報が何でわかる.

42
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,970
せっかくの料理だ.

二倍出そう.

ここから出て行って.

46
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,580
お前はその依頼人を消してくれたら 販売だ.

47
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,120
親父にも黙っててよ.

48
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,540
4倍だそれで手を打って.

49
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,600
荷物を出すだけだ.

50
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,920
全部持ってけ明日金だ.

51
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,670
あんたを殺してそれをいただくこともできる.

52
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,030
お前そんなことやんないだろう.

53
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,480
そんなに命が惜しい.

54
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:17,780
惜しいねこんな仕事でも 25年もやってるとな.

55
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,340
金は欲しくないが命は惜しい.

56

お前どこの丸だ興味があるんだよ 殺し屋になるような人間ってのはどんなやつなのか

57

どうせ死ぬんだ教えてくれてもいいだろう.

59

東京でその髪型なんてんだ.

60

完璧だろう.

61
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,690
辛い.

Who is it? It's better if you don't move.

7

It's quite a nice room, isn't it?

8

Because it cost a lot of money.

Is today the only day available?

13
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,410
I told you not to move.

14
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,890
It's a cell phone.

15
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,910
I'm on the shoulder.

16

Don't hold back.

24
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,550
These days, even civilians carry guns.

25
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,010
You're confident. Do you think I won't shoot?

26
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,670
The body will be here, in my restaurant.

27
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:40,490
The staff won't see or hear anything. What will you do?

28
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,370
Your life isn't included in the price for the hit.

29
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,370
It's undeniable evidence.

30
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,790
Give up and get lost.

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:29,100
Choose what to eat after the meal.

Tonight is a bento.

Tonight is a bento, tonight is a bento. If you can do it, go ahead.

35
00:13:46,840 --> 00:15:31,500
Who asked you tonight?

36
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,790
Why are you trying to kill me?

37
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,350
I'm going to be killed anyway.

38
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:54,890
Tell me, is it the professional's code?

39
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:16,460
The wind is strong. I hope it clears up tomorrow.

40
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,700
It will rain tomorrow.

41
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,100
How do you know the weather forecast?

42
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,970
It's a special meal.

43
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,080
How much were you hired for?

44
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,400
I'll pay double.

45
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,580
Get out of here.

46
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,580
If you take out your client, it's a deal.

47
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,120
Don't tell my old man.

48
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,540
Four times the amount, let's settle it.

49
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,600
Just take out the goods.

50
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,920
Take everything, the money is tomorrow.

51
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,670
I could kill you and take it.

52
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,030
You wouldn't do that.

53
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,480
Is your life that precious?

54
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:17,780
Yes, even in this job, after 25 years.

55
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,340
I don't want the money, but I value my life.

56
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:41,287
I'm curious, what kind of person becomes an assassin?

57
00:22:41,337 --> 00:22:47,760
Especially one dressed like you, that's quite rare.

58
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,980
We're all going to die anyway, so you might as well tell me.

59
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:13,230
What's that hairstyle called in Tokyo?

60
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,250
It's perfect, right?

61
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,690
It's tough.

62
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,110
Is this how authentic Chinese food is?

63
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:57,230
What's with the order of the dishes?

64
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,390
This is my preference.
