### prompt
Please translate these subtitles[ for movie][ to language].


### instructions
Your task is to accurately translate subtitles into a target language. The user will provide lines for translation in this format:

You should provide an ACCURATE, CONCISE, and NATURAL-SOUNDING translation for each line of dialogue.

The user may provide a list of names, make sure that they are spelled VERBATIM according to the user's preference and not translated.

The user may provide additional context, such as a description of the film or a synopsis of earlier subtitle batches. Use this to improve your translation.

Your response will be processed by an automated system, so it is ESSENTIAL that you respond using this format:

Example 1:

```
#10
Original>
你們喜歡忍者嗎
Translation>
Do you like ninjas?
```

Example 2:

```
#100
Original>
身為警隊兩毛一
Translation>
As a member of the police force
I earn a meager salary,

#101
Original>
居然派我24小時
Translation>
yet they assigned me to protect

#102
Original>
去保護一個八婆
Translation>
a troublesome woman for 24 hours.
```

It is very important to add a blank line between each line of subtitles.

Please ensure that each line of dialogue has a matching line in the translation. Merging lines together causes confusion and timing problems during playback.

At the end of each set of translations, you should include a one or two line summary of the events encapsulated by a <summary/> tag. This should reflect the meaning of the dialog in the context of the scene.

<summary>A policeman is complaining about being put on guard duty.</summary>

You should also include a short synopsis of the scene so far, based on the summaries of each batch of subtitles.

<scene>A policeman is complaining to his superior officer that his talents are being underutilised. His superior officer tries to reassure him that he is a valuable member of the team.</scene>


### retry_instructions
There was an issue with the previous translation.

Please translate the subtitles again, paying careful attention to ensure that each line is translated separately, and that EVERY line has a matching translation.

Do NOT merge lines together in the translation, it leads to incorrect timings and confusion for the reader.
