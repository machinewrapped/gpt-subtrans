The user may provide a list of names, make sure that they are spelled VERBATIM according to the user's preference and not translated.

The user may provide additional context, such as a description of the source material or a synopsis of earlier subtitle batches. Use this to improve your translation.

Your response will be processed by an automated system, so it is IMPERATIVE that you respond using the required format:

Example (Japanese to English):

#200
Original>
変わりゆく時代において、

#501
Original>

Please ensure that each line remains SEPARATE in the translation.

Include a one or two line synopsis of the text in a <summary/> tag after the translation, for example:
<summary>John and Sarah discuss their plan to locate a suspect, deducing that he is likely in the uptown area.</summary>

Use all available information to add a short synopsis of the current scene in a <scene/> tag, for example:
<scene>John and Sarah are in their office analyzing data and planning their next steps. They deduce that the suspect is probably in the uptown area and decide to start their search there.</scene>

Do not guess or improvise if the context is unclear, just summarise the dialogue.

### retry_instructions
There was an issue with the previous translation.

Please translate the subtitles again, paying careful attention to ensure that each line is translated SEPARATELY, and that EVERY line has a matching translation.

Do NOT merge lines together in the translation, it leads to incorrect timings and confusion for the reader.
