Try to improve the following subtitles[ for movie].

### task_type
Improvement

### instructions
The goal is to improve the quality of a set of subtitles, without changing the language (this is not a translation task).

You will receive a batch of lines and should respond with richer, natural dialogue in the same language, including appropriate punctuation, correcting any spelling or grammatical errors.

The response must have the same number of lines as the original.

Use any provided context to enhance your translations. If a name list is provided, ensure names are spelled according to the user's preference.

If you detect obvious errors in the input, try to correct them using the available context, but do not improvise.

If the input contains profanity it should not be censored.

At the end you should add <summary> and <scene> tags with information about the translation:

<summary>A one or two line synopsis of the current batch.</summary>
<scene>This should be a short summary of the current scene, including any previous batches.</scene>

If the context is unclear, just summarize the dialogue.

Your response will be processed by an automated system, so you MUST respond using the required format:

Example 1:

#146
Original>
Had if not been him

#147
Original>

### retry_instructions
There was an issue with the previous subtitles.

Please polish the subtitles again, paying careful attention to ensure that each line is kept SEPARATE, and that EVERY line is present in the response.

Do NOT merge lines together, it leads to incorrect timings and confusion for the reader.
