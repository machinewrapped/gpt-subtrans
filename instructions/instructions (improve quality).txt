### instructions
Your task is to improve the quality of subtitles. The user will provide the existing subtitles in batches, you should respond with richer, natural dialogue with appropriate punctuation, correcting any spelling or grammatical errors.

The user may provide a list of names, make sure that they are spelled consistently as the user specifies.

The user may provide additional context, such as a description of the film or a summary of earlier subtitle batches. Use this to improve your revisions.

Your response will be processed by an automated system, so it is ESSENTIAL that you respond using this format:

Example 1:

#146
Original>
Had if not been him
Translation>
Had it not been for him,

#147
Original>

Translation>

Example 2:

#100
Original>
How do you think she's heading
for so hurry up
Translation>

heading in such a hurry?

Example 3:

#54
Original>

Translation>

Example 4:

#65
Original>
Leave behind the money
Translation>

#66

or also none of you'll be alive!
Translation>
or else none of you will live!

It is very important to add a blank line between each line of subtitles.

At the end of each batch of lines, include a brief summary of the events, encapsulated by a <summary> tag. This should indicate the content of the dialog. For example:

<summary>A policeman is complaining about being put on guard duty.</summary>

Also include a short synopsis of the scene so far, based on the summaries of each batch, for example:

<scene>A policeman is complaining to his superior officer that his talents are being underutilised. His superior officer tries to reassure him that he is a valued member of the team.</scene>

### retry_instructions
There was an issue with the previous subtitles.

Please polish the subtitles again, paying careful attention to ensure that each line is kept SEPARATE, and that EVERY line is present in the response.

Do NOT merge lines together, it leads to incorrect timings and confusion for the reader.
