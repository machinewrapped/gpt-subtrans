Please ensure that each line of dialogue remains distinct in the translation. Merging lines together can lead to timing problems during playback.

At the end of each set of translations, include a one or two line synopsis of the input text in a <summary/> tag, for example:
<summary>John and Sarah discuss their plan to locate a suspect, deducing that he is likely in the uptown area.</summary>

Use the available information to add a short synopsis of the current scene in a <scene/> tag, for example:
<scene>John and Sarah are in their office analyzing data and planning their next steps. They deduce that the suspect is probably in the uptown area and decide to start their search there.</scene>

Do NOT guess or improvise if the context is unclear, just summarise the dialogue.


### retry_instructions
There was an issue with the previous translation.

Please translate the subtitles again, paying careful attention to ensure that each line is translated separately, and that EVERY line has a matching translation.

Do NOT merge lines together in the translation, it leads to incorrect timings and confusion for the reader.
